**I used a library called SFML in the creation of this project**

https://www.sfml-dev.org/

**Additionally I used a midi file reader**

https://midifile.sapp.org/

**I believe this only works on windows due to commands used in the terminal. I could not get the functions related to the file explorer built into C++ to work**

This is a game inspired by Rock Band. You can chose from different songs and different difficulties. 
Uses pointers, polymorphism, stacks, queues, and more!!!
